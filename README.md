# LuiaTok

LuiaTok is a TikTok clone built with Next.js. This project aims to replicate the core features and functionality of the popular social media platform TikTok, allowing users to create and share short-form videos with a global audience.

## Technologies Used

LuiaTok is built using the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: A React-based framework for building server-rendered and statically-generated web applications. Next.js provides features such as automatic code splitting, optimized prefetching, and server-side rendering to help developers build fast and scalable web applications.

- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that adds type annotations and other features to the language. TypeScript allows developers to catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime, improving the reliability and maintainability of their code.

- **Sanity.io**: A platform for structured content that allows developers to define and manage content models using a real-time API. Sanity.io provides a powerful and flexible content management system that can be customized to fit the needs of any project.

- **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scalable state management solution for React. Zustand provides a simple and intuitive API for managing application state, making it easy for developers to build complex and dynamic user interfaces.

## Features

LuiaTok includes the following features:

- **Video Upload**: Users can upload short-form videos to share with others on the platform.
- **Video Feed**: Users can browse a feed of videos from other users, sorted by recency.
- **User Profiles**: Users can create their own profiles and store likes and videos.
- **Social Interactions**: Users can interact with videos by liking, commenting, or sharing them with others.

## Architecture

LuiaTok is built using a modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes code reusability. The application is divided into several layers, including:

- **Presentation Layer**: This layer is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. It is built using Next.js and React.

- **Data Layer**: This layer is responsible for managing application data and communicating with external data sources. It uses Sanity.io to store and retrieve structured content.

- **State Management Layer**: This layer is responsible for managing application state and coordinating data flow between different parts of the application. It uses Zustand to manage state in a simple and scalable manner.

## Development

LuiaTok is developed using modern development practices and tools. The codebase is written in TypeScript and follows a consistent coding style. It is used ESLint to enforce code quality and Prettier to automatically format our code.
